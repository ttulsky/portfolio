I am a voracious learner, and the diverse spectrum of\n      subjects within the realm of coding offers a continuously unfolding\n      landscape for exploration. The evolving nature of the industry keeps me\n      perpetually engaged and impassioned.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      My journey into the world of coding began with Wix, an intuitive platform\n      that fostered my interest in website creation. Despite its user-friendly\n      interface, I quickly realized I yearned for a deeper understanding and\n      more control over my creations, leading me to enroll in a Python bootcamp.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      The bootcamp served as my springboard into the realm of programming,\n      equipping me with the fundamentals of Python and a profound curiosity to\n      learn more. Eager to build on this foundation, I embarked on another\n      immersive experience, this time with a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React,\n      and Node.js) stack bootcamp. This experience deepened my knowledge and\n      skills, particularly in the realm of full-stack development, and cemented\n      my passion for coding.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      As a part of my continuous learning endeavor, I graduated into working\n      with Vue and TypeScript. These powerful tools enhanced my ability to\n      create dynamic, efficient, and robust web applications, further expanding\n      my skill set. My journey through JavaScript, Python, MERN stack, Vue, and\n      TypeScript has been incredibly rewarding and stimulating, equipping me\n      with the toolkit to bring diverse and complex web projects to life.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In my approach to web development, I prioritize intuitive, user-friendly\n      layouts that encapsulate a seamless browsing experience. I strongly\n      believe in the pursuit of continuous improvement, considering each project\n      not as a completed task, but as an ongoing evolution. My dedication to\n      this ethos ensures that I bring unwavering commitment to actualizing your\n      vision.\n    </p>\n    <br />\n    <p>\n      Let's collaborate to craft something extraordinary. I look forward to our\n      journey of creation together!\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</template>\n<script>\nimport BtmHero from \"../components/BtmHero.vue\";\n\nexport default {\n  components: {\n    BtmHero: BtmHero,\n  },\n};\n</script>\n\n<style scoped>\n.about {\n  padding: 5% 50px;\n  font-family: \"Helvetica Neue\", sans-serif;\n  color: #333;\n  line-height: 1.6;\n  text-align: justify;\n  background-color: #f9f9f9;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n}\n\n.about p {\n  margin-bottom: 20px;\n}\n\n.about p:last-child {\n  text-align: center;\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n</style>\n"],"mappings":"AAsDA,OAAOA,OAAM,MAAO,2BAA2B;AAE/C,eAAe;EACbC,UAAU,EAAE;IACVD,OAAO,EAAEA;EACX;AACF,CAAC"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
